1. Save Tweety
Silvester and Tweety are friends. Bender was one of the Silvester's enemy. One day Silvester and Tweety went on to a trip. Bender planned to kidnap Tweety.. He kidnapped and kept her in one of the  hot balloons tied up to a height. There were 50 hot balloons numbered from one. Each balloon will fly to a certain height. Only the numbers  having both  3 and 7 as its factors can fly upto the height of the Tweety's balloon. Silvester was confused and he didn't know which numbered balloon can fly to Tweety. (Note: If balloon number is greater than 50, or balloon number less than 1, then it should display invalid balloon number)
ANS: BEGIN
   DECLARE variable number
   READ number
   IF 
number > 50
 
OR number < 1
 THEN
            PRINT 
"Invalid balloon number "

   ELSE IF 
number%3 == 0
 
AND number%7 == 0
 THEN
           
PRINT
 
"This balloon can fly to Tweety"

  
ELSE

           
PRINT
 
"This balloon cannot fly to Tweety"

  
END IF

2. Hide and Seek 

One day, Bunny and his friends were playing hide and seek in the forest. Tom went along to hide. He finds an abandoned bag containing a board(8x8) game in a cave. He gets excited and starts playing the game only to realizes that it's magical. He has three chances to roll the dice. Each turn's outcome will lead into a new surrounding and some would be dangerous. If the outcome of rolling dices is in multiples of 3 then he will be caught in a dangerous phase. 

 Note if any one outcome is multiple of 3, then tom is in danger. 

 (If the outcome of rolling dices is either 0 or less than that you should tell Tom as "Invalid Turn". ) 
 ANS:
 BEGIN 

DECLARE variables  turn1,turn2,turn3 

READ turn1, turn2, turn3 

IF turn1>0 AND turn2>0 AND turn3>0 THEN 

IF turn1%3==0 OR turn2%3==0 OR turn3%3==0 THEN 

PRINT "Tom is in Danger" 

ELSE 

PRINT "Tom is Safe" 

END IF 

ELSE 

    PRINT "Invalid turn" 

END IF
