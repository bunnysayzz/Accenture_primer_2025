Topic: Introduction to Algorithms, Flowcharts & Pseudocode


1. Stephany is learning to draw a flowchart to calculate the area of a circle. Select the appropriate option that would fit into the process section of the flow chart?


Select one:

a.
Print the area

b.
Area=3.14*radius*radius

c.
Read the value of radius

d.
Check if radius has positive value

Any process/action involved in a problem would fit into the process section of a flowchart and should be denoted by the rectangle symbol. Calculation of area is the process involved in the above problem

The correct answer is: Area=3.14*radius*radius


2. Choose the correct arrangement of mathematical symbols to make the equation true.



a.
600 [+] 400 [‑] 800 [×] 300 [/] 200 = 200



b.
600 [/] 400 [+] 800 [‑] 300 [×] 200 = 200



c.
600 [‑] 400 [+] 800 [/] 300 [×] 200 = 200



d.
 600 [×] 400 [/] 800 [-] 300 [+] 200 = 200


The correct answer is:

 600 [×] 400 [/] 800 [-] 300 [+] 200 = 200

3. Match the symbols and flowchart to its appropriate functionality

Rectangle: Process
Parallelogram: Input/output
Diamond: Decision making


4. An algorithm described in the form of programming language is (Note: not exactly to any particular programming language, but by using few programming constructs) :  pseudocode

5. Which of the following represents the correct sequence for the given pseudo-code?

BEGIN

-------------

-------------

-------------

-------------

END


b. (CORRECT)
DECLARE variables – number1, number2, result

READ number1 and number2

result <- number1 * number2

PRINT result


6. Rearrange the pseudo-code for multiplying two given numbers, Choose the correct option from the below.

 1 BEGIN

 2 result <- number1 * number2

 3 PRINT result

 4 READ number 1 and number 2

 5 DECLARE variables – number1, number2, result

 6 END


c. (CORRECT)
1 5 4 2 3 6


7. Examine the correct logic with their descriptions

BEGIN
            DECLARE mark1, mark2, mark3, average
            READ mark1, mark2, mark3
            average <- (mark1+mark2+mark3)/3
            PRINT average
END

Answer 1
finding the average mark of three subjects

BEGIN
            DECLARE principal, number_of_years, rate_of_interest,result
            READ principal, number_of_years, rate_of_interest
            result <---(principal* number_of_years*, rate_of_interest)/100
            PRINT result
END

Answer 2
calculating simple interest problem

BEGIN
            DECLARE radius,circumference
            READ radius
            circumference <---- 2*3.14*radius
            PRINT circumference
END

Answer 3
calculating the perimeter of a circle

8. Which of the following represents the correct sequence for the given pseudo-code?

BEGIN

   [1] READ mark1, mark2, mark3, mark4, mark5

   [2] PRINT average

   [3] total < mark1 + mark2 + mark3 + mark4 + mark5

   [4] average < total / 5

   [5] DECLARE mark1, mark2, mark3, mark4, mark5, total, average

END

d. (CORRECT)
5 1 3 4 2

9. Match the appropriate Flowchart symbols with its purpose.

The correct answer is:

Rounded Rectangle: Start/Stop

Circle: Connector

->: Flow direction

Diamond: Decision making

Rectangle: Process

Parallelogram: Input/output


10. Which of the following represents the correct sequence for the given algorithm?


a. (CORRECT)
Start

Get the two numbers.

Add the two numbers and store the result in sum.

Display the sum value.

Stop



11. Arrange the words given below in a meaningful sequence.

1. Word, 2. Paragraph, 3. Sentence, 4. Letters, 5. phrase

Select one:

d. (CORRECT)
4,1,5,3,2


12. Flow chart for adding numbers, Is the given flowchart correct?

Input/output process like reading values, getting input from the user is denoted by parallelogram symbol
The correct answer is: The symbol for reading input from the user is incorrect


13. Choose the correct and meaningful pseudo-code to add two numbers?

Correct Answer: b.

BEGIN

        DECLARE  number1,number2,sum

        READ number1,number2

        sum<----number1+number2

        PRINT sum

END

14. Expression is a combination of ___________, ____________ and _______________
ans: variables, constants, operators

15. Identify the meaningful variable names which can be used? Select one or more:

Variable names should not start with a number, should not have spaces in between, should not start with symbols except dollar( $ ) and underscore( _ )

The correct answers are: registerNumber, user1
