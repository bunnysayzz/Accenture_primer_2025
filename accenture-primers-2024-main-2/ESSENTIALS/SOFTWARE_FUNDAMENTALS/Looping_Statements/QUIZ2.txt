1. Select the appropriate code snippet for the given problem statement provided as pseudocode. 

Problem Statement : 
Strong number 

Check if a given number is a strong number. 145 is a strong number because 1!+4!+5! = 145.  

  

Sample Input : 

145 

Sample Output : 

Strong number 

  

Code: 

BEGIN 

DECLARE variables number, sum, temp, remainder, fact 

READ number 

SET sum=0, temp=number 

__________________ 

remainder = number % 10 

SET fact = 1 

FOR i IN 1 to remainder DO 

fact = fact *i 

END FOR 

sum = sum+ fact 

number = number / 10 

END WHILE 

IF sum==temp THEN 

PRINT "Strong number" 

ELSE 

PRINT "Not a Strong number" 

END IF 

END 

ANS: WHILE number != 0

2. Choose the pseudocode for the below problem statement. 

Problem Statement : 

Vehicle Registration 

Mr.William buys a new Audi car. During the vehicle registration, he desires a fancy number in such a way that both the number and its reverse are the same. 

Generate an algorithm to find that fancy number. 

  

Sample Input : 

1221 

Sample Output : 

Number is Fancy 

ANS:
BEGIN 

DECLARE  variables number, reverse, rem, temp 

READ number 

SET reverse = 0, temp = number 

WHILE number !=0 DO 

rem = number%10 

reverse = reverse*10 + rem 

number = number/10 

END WHILE 

IF temp == reverse THEN 

PRINT "Number is Fancy" 

ELSE 

PRINT "Number is Not Fancy" 

END IF 

END
