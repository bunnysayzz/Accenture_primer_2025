1. Which of the following is NOT a property of likelihood?
ANS: It is normalized like a probability

2. Which model type aims to capture the joint probability P(x, y)?
ANS: Generative Model

3.Which claim regarding generative models isn't true?
ANS: They always require labeled data for training

4. Which of the following best describes the difference between generative and discriminative models?
ANS: Generative models learn the data distribution, while discriminative models learn the decision boundary

5. Within the architecture of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which duo of fundamental elements are paramount?
ANS: Generator and Discriminator

6. For what tasks can generative models be applied?
ANS: Data generation, denoising, inpainting, and more

7. What does a probability distribution provide?
ANS: A mathematical description of outcomes for a random variable

8. What's a significant hurdle when training GANs?
ANS: Mode collapse

9. Within generative models, what function does the discriminator serve in GANs?
ANS: To distinguish between real and generated data

10. How is the likelihood of data given a model symbolized?
ANS: P(data | model)
