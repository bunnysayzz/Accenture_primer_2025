ANS: Discriminative model

2. Which model type is primarily concerned with determining P(y | x)?
ANS: Discriminative Model

3. What is the primary goal of generative models in AI?
ANS: To generate new data samples

4. Which statement best differentiates generative from discriminative models?
ANS: Generative models learn the joint probability distribution, while discriminative models learn the conditional probability

5. Which of the following is crucial for understanding the behavior of generative models?
ANS: Probability distributions and likelihood

6. In the context of generative models, what does P(x) represent?
ANS: The probability distribution of the data x

7. Which of the following is NOT a generative model?
ANS: Support Vector Machines

8. Generative models are primarily used for which of the following tasks?
ANS: Generating new data samples similar to the input data

9. What does likelihood measure in the context of a model?
ANS: How well the model explains the observed data
