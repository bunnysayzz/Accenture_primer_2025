ANS: Anomaly Detection

2. What is the y-axis label of the chart visualizing the error?
ANS: Reconstruction Error

3. Which is NOT a challenge in implementing VAEs for this use-case?
ANS: Increasing data storage costs

4. For how many epochs is the VAE trained?
ANS: 50

5. What criterion is used to determine if a data point is anomalous?
ANS: If its error is above the 99th percentile

6. What is the VAE trained to learn effectively?
ANS: A compressed representation of the data

7. Why is understanding the VAE's outputs challenging?
ANS: They can be complex and non-intuitive

8. In the VAE, what does the sampling function introduce?
ANS: Randomness

9. What two components combine to form the VAE's loss?
ANS: MSE and KL divergence

10. Which of the following is NOT an attribute in the given data?

ANS: Time Series Dataset

12. How is the data divided for training the VAE?
ANS: 80-20

13. What does the VAE attempt to minimize during training?
ANS: Loss

14. Why is data preprocessing required before training the VAE?
ANS: To ensure it is suitable for training
